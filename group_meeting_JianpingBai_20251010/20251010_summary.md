In the group meeting, we discussed the paper Enhancing Graph Neural Network-based Fraud Detectors against Camouflaged Fraudsters.This paper proposed the model CARE-GNN( Camouflage-Resistant Graph Neural Network). This work tackles the challenge of camouflaged fraudsters by introducing three key modules: a label-aware similarity measure, a reinforcement-learning-based neighbor selector, and a relation-aware aggregator. CARE-GNN enhances the robustness of GNNs in fraud detection and shows strong performance on Yelp and Amazon datasets, effectively identifying feature and relation camouflage.
