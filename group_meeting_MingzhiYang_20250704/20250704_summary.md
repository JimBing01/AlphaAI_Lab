We shared the paper "MarS: A Financial Market Simulation Engine Powered by Generative Foundation Model." This paper aims to address the lack of realism, interactivity, and controllability in existing financial market simulators at the order level, exploring the application of generative models to the virtual world of finance. Leveraging a novel order-level generative foundation model called the "Large Market Model" (LMM), the authors built the MarS engine. This model uses an ensemble architecture that combines an "Order Model" to capture micro-level impacts and an "Order-Batch Model”, which converts order batches into "order images”, for macro-level control. Empirical results show that the LMM exhibits strong scaling laws and that MarS simulations can highly reproduce the market's "stylized facts" and the "square-root law" of market impact. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that MarS, as a unified platform, has the potential to bring a "paradigm shift" to downstream applications such as market forecasting, risk detection, "what if" analysis, and training environments for reinforcement learning agents.
