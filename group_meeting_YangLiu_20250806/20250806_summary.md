We shared the paper Memory and Generative AI in this meeting. This paper tries to understand Generative AI’s decisions under risk as an economic agent. Exploiting a novel experimental setting, the paper shows that it uses memories to make decisions, even when they are not in the same decision domain. When displayed with irrelevant images with positive feelings, it becomes more risk-loving and will choose to invest more in stocks, and vice versa. Although emotional shocks strongly bias investment choices, they have minimal impact on GAI’s beliefs. This mechanism is further causally supported with a supervised fine-tuning technique known as knowledge injection that can edit the language model’s memories. Empirical results show that both domain-specific memories, like financial news, and non-domain-specific memories, like Yelp restaurant reviews, significantly affect GAI’s investment choices.
