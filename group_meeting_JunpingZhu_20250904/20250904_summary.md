In this meeting, we discussed the paper: Machine Learning for Continuous-Time Finance. This paper develops an algorithm for solving a large class of nonlinear high-dimensional continuous-time models in finance. It approximates value and policy functions using deep learning and shows that a combination of automatic differentiation and Ito’s lemma allows for the computation of exact expectations, resulting in a negligible computational cost that is independent of the number of state variables. It illustrates the applicability of the method to problems in asset pricing, corporate finance, and portfolio choice and shows that the ability to solve high-dimensional problems allows people to derive new economic insights.
