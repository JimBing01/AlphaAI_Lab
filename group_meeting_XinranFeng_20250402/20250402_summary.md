This meeting covered NLP fundamentals and advanced LLMs. It highlighted how DeepSeek-R1 evolved from DeepSeek-R1-Zero with improved reasoning and readability using minimal supervised data and reinforcement learning. To demonstrate the power of distillation, a related work, Fin-R1, was introduced. It was distilled from deepseek-R1 with domain data, and it achieved higher performance than some larger models.
